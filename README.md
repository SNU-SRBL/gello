## GELLO (SRBL Fork)

This is the SRBL group's fork of [GELLO](https://wuphilipp.github.io/gello_site/), a general, low-cost, and intuitive teleoperation framework for robot manipulators. The original repository and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/wuphilipp/gello_software).

In this fork, we organize multiple GELLO system variations developed by our lab (SRBL ‚Äì Soft Robotics and Bionics Laboratory) for different purposes:

### üìÅ Folder Overview

* **`gello_ft/`**
  GELLO system extended with 6-axis Force-Torque sensing for collecting interaction forces during teleoperation.

* **`gello_nogripper/`**
  GELLO system variant without a gripper, used for simplified manipulation or hardware setups lacking end-effectors.

* **`gello_youngjin/`**
  A customized GELLO configuration tailored for Youngjin Choi's project.

* **`gello_DIGIT/`**
  GELLO system extended with 6-axis Force-Torque sensor and DIGIT vision-based tactile sensor.

We will provide detailed instructions and descriptions inside each folder‚Äôs own `README.md`.
